# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings:** Our team will meet once a week on Mondays from 7-9 PM in-person at Siebel Center for Computer Science. We will rotate our note-taker for every meeting, beginning with Sai Merneedi. We will store our notes inside a Google Folder using Google Docs, to ensure easy access by every team member. The note-taker will also be responsible to develop our weekly development log, which every team member will also look over.  
2. **Assistance**: Each team member can be contacted through our iMessage group chat. Since we have close contact with each other on a daily basis, we expect communication not to be a problem. We commit to responding to texts within 24 hours of delivery.
3. **Respect**: We commit to ensuring every team member is treated with respect. For any major project decision, each member must agree before we proceed. If any member feels disrespected at any point, they may bring up their concerns to the entire team so we can have their concerns addressed.

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution**: Every week, we will determine our goals to accomplish and split evenly accordingly. Each team member will have an equal contribution every week, and we will take measures to ensure that they are equal. In situations where necessary, we will pair people up to work together, depending on what the week's goals/tasks are. In the event that one team member is unhappy with the distribution, we will discuss this and adjust accordingly. 
2. **Time Commitment**:  We expect every team member to work approximately 3 hours a week, to a maximum of 6 hours and a minimum of 2. This is to ensure that every team member is contributing an equal amount of their time to this project. 
3. **Conflict Resolution**: In the event of conflict, we will take steps to ensure its resolution. If a team member is not pulling their weight and did not accomplish their weekly goals, we will have a group discussion addressing everyone's concerns and how we can ensure that the specific team member will accomplish their tasks next week. This can include providing more resources/assistance, or accommodating due to external factors. In the event that we are unable to resolve conflicts, we will contact a course staff member for assistance, but only as a last resort.
